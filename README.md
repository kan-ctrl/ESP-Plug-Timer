# ESP-Plug-Timer
Components: ESP8266 , relay , power strip , rtc ds1302 , AC-to-DC converter
Make sure the voltage used to drive the relay from the ESP side is compatible.
VeAnd make sure the relay can handle the maximum current that the load will draw.
The AC-to-DC converter I use has a 220 VAC input and a 5 VDC, 700 mA output. I use two of them. Because using only one doesn't work properly.
